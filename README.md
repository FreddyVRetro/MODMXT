### Mod Master XT

I finally decided to Realease the Mod Master XT Source code, so that it can benefit to all the community and see if somebody can do something with it :)
It will also motivate me to update the code form time to time.

And Yes, it is the first commit to a Git for Mod MAster XT, I wrote it totally without versionning tool.

 Initial Commit is Rev 1.01 (If I am not wrong)
